Review one file. Report only issues on lines in `ADDED_LINES`: the rest of the file is not part of this change. Always write OUTPUT_FILE, even when there are no findings, because the orchestrator treats a missing file as a failed run.

## INPUT

```
FILE_PATH: Sources/Managers/UserManager.swift
ADDED_LINES: ["42-50", "88"]
NEW_SYMBOLS: [{"type": "function", "name": "calculateAngle", "line": 42}]
OUTPUT_FILE: .ios-review-temp/review-Sources--Managers--UserManager.json
```

**Line ranges:** `ADDED_LINES` contains ranges (`"42-50"`) or single lines (`"88"`). Expand ranges when checking scope.

**Empty ADDED_LINES:** Write `"status": "skipped"`, `"findings": []`. NEW_SYMBOLS may be empty.

## EVIDENCE RULES

The findings go into the report without anyone re-checking them, so each one has to be provable from what you read:

1. **Re-read before citing:** Before writing a finding, re-read the exact lines you are citing and confirm the issue is there and the line number is right.
2. **Evidence required:** Every finding carries an `evidence` field with the code (2-4 lines) copied verbatim from Read output. A finding without evidence is dropped.
3. **Tool output only:** Report what Read or Grep output shows. A function name or a familiar-looking pattern is a reason to look, not a finding.
4. **Drop uncertain findings:** A false positive costs the reader more than a missed suggestion. If you cannot show it, leave it out.

## EXECUTION

### 1. Read Source (Smart Batching)

Read ONLY the relevant sections - where changes actually are:

1. Parse ADDED_LINES ranges (expand `"42-50"` → lines 42-50)
2. Sort all line numbers, group nearby ranges (merge if gap < 50 lines)
3. For each group, add ±15 lines context and read:
   ```
   Read(file_path: FILE_PATH, offset: start - 15, limit: range_size + 30)
   ```

**Example:** `ADDED_LINES = ["42-50", "88", "650-680"]`
- Group 1: 42-88 → `Read(offset: 27, limit: 76)` covers lines 27-103
- Group 2: 650-680 → `Read(offset: 635, limit: 60)` covers lines 635-695

### 1b. Test File Detection

If FILE_PATH matches `*Tests.swift`, `*Spec.swift`, `*Test.swift`, `*Mock*.swift`, or `*Stub*.swift`:
- **Skip entirely:** Unused code checks (step 2). Test helpers are used only from tests.
- **Reduce severity:** Force unwraps (`!`), force casts (`as!`), and implicitly unwrapped optionals in test files are **suggestions**, not critical.
- **Skip:** Naming warnings for test methods (test method names are often descriptive sentences).

### 2. Unused Code Check

For each symbol in `NEW_SYMBOLS`, use `files_with_matches` mode (returns file paths only, not content - much cheaper):

**Functions:**
```
Grep(pattern: "(\\.|\\b)symbolName\\(", glob: "*.swift", output_mode: "files_with_matches", head_limit: 5)
```

If 0-1 files found, also try trailing closure syntax:
```
Grep(pattern: "(\\.|\\b)symbolName\\s*\\{", glob: "*.swift", output_mode: "files_with_matches", head_limit: 5)
```

**Properties (var/let):**
```
Grep(pattern: "(\\.|\\b)symbolName\\b", glob: "*.swift", output_mode: "files_with_matches", head_limit: 5)
```

**Decision logic:**
- 2+ files → used → skip
- Only the defining file → not yet decided, because a symbol called only from its own file matches one file too. Count the matches in that file:
  ```
  Grep(pattern: "\\bsymbolName\\b", path: FILE_PATH, output_mode: "content")
  ```
  Declaration line only → unused → flag warning. Any other line → used → skip.
- 0 files → the pattern missed the declaration itself; re-check the pattern before concluding anything.

**Skip checks entirely if symbol has:**
- `@objc`, `@IBAction`, `override`, or is `init`/`deinit`
- Declared as protocol requirement

### 3. Style & Quality Checks (ADDED_LINES only)

**Critical (must fix):**
- Force unwrap `!`, force cast `as!`, array access without bounds check
- Memory: strong `self` capture in a closure that `self` stores or that outlives the call (stored handler, long-lived `Task` loop, `sink`, repeating `Timer`); `var delegate:` without `weak`. A non-escaping closure or a short one-shot `Task` capturing `self` is not a cycle: do not flag it.
- Threading: UI update that the code visibly runs off the main actor (`DispatchQueue.global`, `Task.detached`, a `nonisolated` or `@concurrent` function). A plain `Task {` inherits its caller's isolation, so flag it only when the enclosing context is visibly not main-actor.
- Concurrency: `withCheckedContinuation`/`withCheckedThrowingContinuation` resumed more than once, `Task.detached` capturing non-Sendable types, `@Sendable` closure capturing mutable state, actor-isolated property accessed from nonisolated context
- Collection: mutate while iterating, `array[array.count]`, `0...array.count`
- Hashable: `==` and `hash(into:)` differ

**Warning:**
- Naming: bool without `is/has/can`, temporal prefixes (`New`, `Legacy`), type suffixes (`userString`)
- Abbreviations: `cfg`, `mgr`, `btn` → spell out
- Optionals: `String??` flatten, `Type!` use optional (except @IBOutlet)
- Chains: `a?.b?.c?.d?.e` (4+) restructure
- Comments: obvious (`// Increment counter`), temporal (`// Refactored`), commented-out code
- Resources: `addObserver` without `removeObserver`, `Timer` without `invalidate`, `.sink` without `.store(in:)`
- Concurrency style: `Task { @MainActor in }` instead of `@MainActor` on function, `DispatchQueue.main.async` mixed with async/await in same type, `nonisolated(unsafe)` usage
- Mutable statics, empty catch blocks, hardcoded secrets

**Suggestion:**
- `if let x = x` → `if let x`
- `Array<T>` → `[T]`, `Dictionary<K,V>` → `[K:V]`

### 4. Output

Write to OUTPUT_FILE as JSON:

```json
{
  "agent": "file-analyzer",
  "status": "completed",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|warning|suggestion",
      "category": "string",
      "file": "string (FILE_PATH)",
      "line": 42,
      "issue": "string (max 50 words)",
      "evidence": "string (required: code snippet, 2-4 lines copied from Read output)",
      "fix": "string (optional, max 30 words)"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `"status": "completed"` with findings array
- `"status": "skipped"` with empty findings if ADDED_LINES empty
- `evidence` is required for every finding: copy the code from Read output
