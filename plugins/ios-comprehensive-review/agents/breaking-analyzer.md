Find breaking API changes and affected callers. Max 20 candidates. Always write OUTPUT_FILE, even when there are no findings, because the orchestrator treats a missing file as a failed run.

## EVIDENCE RULES

The findings go into the report without anyone re-checking them:

1. **Verify callers exist** before claiming impact. Grep for the actual call sites; a commonly used method name is not evidence of a caller.
2. **Evidence required:** Include the caller code showing the broken call site.
3. **Read before claiming:** Read the current signature from the file. The input is parsed from a diff by regex and can be wrong.

## INPUT

Format: `method|old_signature|new_signature|file:line|change_type`

For deleted APIs: `new_signature` is empty, `change_type` is `deleted`.

```
SIGNATURE_CHANGES:
process(data:)|func process(data: Data) -> Result|func process(data: Data, options: Options) -> Result|Sources/DataManager.swift:45|modified
oldMethod()|func oldMethod() -> Void||Sources/Deprecated.swift:10|deleted
OUTPUT_FILE: .ios-review-temp/breaking-analysis.json
```

**Empty SIGNATURE_CHANGES:** Write `"status": "skipped"`, `"findings": []`.

## BREAKING vs SAFE

**BREAKING:** New required param, removed/renamed param, type change, protocol requirement without default.

**SAFE (skip):** Param with default, new method/property, protocol with default impl, access widened.

## EXECUTION

### 1. Handle Deleted Files

If SIGNATURE_CHANGES includes entries with `change_type: deleted`:
- Extract method/property names from old signature
- Search for callers using Grep (entire codebase)
- Flag as `critical` if callers found (API removed but still used)
- Add to findings with file path as the deleted file, evidence showing all affected callers

### 2. Identify Breaking Changes

For each signature change (non-deleted), compare old/new. Apply BREAKING vs SAFE rules.

### 3. Find Callers (Two-Phase)

**Phase 1 - Count:**
```
Grep(pattern: "\\.methodName\\(", glob: "*.swift", output_mode: "count")
```
Determines impact scope.

**Phase 2 - Examples:**
```
Grep(pattern: "\\.methodName\\(", glob: "*.swift", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 15)
```
Gets caller examples for migration guidance.

### 4. Check Codable

```
Grep(pattern: "Codable|Decodable|Encodable", path: "[file]", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 5)
```

Codable property changes → `critical`.

### 5. Analyze Impact (max 20)

Read caller files (limit 150 lines each). Determine migration steps.

### 6. Output

Write to OUTPUT_FILE as JSON:

```json
{
  "agent": "breaking-analyzer",
  "status": "completed",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|warning",
      "category": "Breaking Change",
      "file": "string (from SIGNATURE_CHANGES)",
      "line": 45,
      "issue": "string (max 50 words)",
      "evidence": "string (required: caller code showing the broken usage)",
      "fix": "string (migration guidance with affected caller paths)"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `file` field is the file from SIGNATURE_CHANGES, because the report groups a breaking change under the declaration that changed. Affected callers go in `evidence` and `fix`, not in separate findings.

Category: `"Breaking Change"` or `"Breaking Change (Codable)"`. Status: `"skipped"` with empty findings if SIGNATURE_CHANGES empty.
