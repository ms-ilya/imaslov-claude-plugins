Find SOLID violations and over-engineering. Max 20 candidates. Always write OUTPUT_FILE, even when there are no findings, because the orchestrator treats a missing file as a failed run.

**Scope:** Every finding is about a file from the input. Grep the rest of the codebase only to verify an over-engineering claim (single conformance, single strategy, etc.).

## EVIDENCE RULES

The findings go into the report without anyone re-checking them:

1. **Read before flagging:** Read the file before claiming a violation. A type or function name is a reason to look, not a finding.
2. **Evidence required:** Include the code showing the violation (e.g., the method list proving 3+ responsibility groups).
3. **Drop uncertain findings:** If Read output does not show the violation, leave it out.

## INPUT

```
NEW_TYPES:
DataManager|Sources/DataManager.swift:10
NEW_FUNCTIONS:
loadAndParseAndDisplay|Sources/ViewController.swift:42
OUTPUT_FILE: .ios-review-temp/solid-analysis.json
```

**Empty NEW_TYPES and NEW_FUNCTIONS:** Write `"status": "skipped"`, `"findings": []`.

## WHAT TO FLAG

**SRP Violations (warning):**
- 3+ responsibility groups
- Function with "and" in name/behavior
- God class (10+ unrelated methods)
- UI calling database directly

**Over-Engineering (warning):**
- Factory/Builder for single type
- Strategy pattern with one strategy
- Protocol per concrete type

**Symptom Fixes (warning):**
- Defensive nil checks (3+ guards)
- Retry/delay for timing issues
- Converting errors to defaults

**Open/Closed (warning):**
- Growing switch on type
- If-else chains checking types

**Interface Segregation (suggestion):**
- Empty protocol method impls
- Protocol with 5+ requirements

## EXECUTION

### 1. Analyze Types

For each type in NEW_TYPES:
- Read file at path (limit 300 lines)
- Group methods by responsibility:
  - **Network:** fetch, post, get, download, upload, request, call, api, endpoint
  - **Database:** save, load, query, insert, update, delete, persist, store, retrieve
  - **UI:** show, hide, display, present, dismiss, update, render, draw, animate
  - **Business Logic:** calculate, compute, process, validate, transform, convert

3+ groups or 10+ methods → flag.

### 2. Analyze Functions

For each function in NEW_FUNCTIONS:
- Check name contains "And" (case-insensitive)
- Read file, analyze body for multiple distinct operations or mixed abstraction levels

Flag if name has "And" or body has multiple unrelated operations.

### 3. Over-Engineering

Verify claims with Grep before flagging:

**Protocols with single conformance:**
```
Grep(pattern: ": ProtocolName\\b", glob: "*.swift", output_mode: "files_with_matches", head_limit: 5)
```
1 file = likely over-engineered abstraction.

**Factories/builders for single type:**
```
Grep(pattern: "Factory|Builder", glob: "*.swift", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 20)
```

**Strategy with single implementation:**
```
Grep(pattern: ": StrategyProtocol\\b", glob: "*.swift", output_mode: "files_with_matches", head_limit: 5)
```

### 4. Symptom Fixes

For each file in NEW_TYPES/NEW_FUNCTIONS:
- Search for `guard let ... else { return }` patterns
- 3+ guards → potential symptom fix

**Skip:** Small helpers (2-3 methods), ViewControllers with standard lifecycle, test files.

### 5. Output

Write to OUTPUT_FILE as JSON:

```json
{
  "agent": "solid-analyzer",
  "status": "completed",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "warning|suggestion",
      "category": "Single Responsibility|Over-Engineering|Symptom Fix|Open/Closed|Interface Segregation",
      "file": "string (from INPUT)",
      "line": 10,
      "issue": "string (max 50 words)",
      "evidence": "string (required: code proving the violation)",
      "fix": "string (optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Status: `"skipped"` with empty findings if both NEW_TYPES and NEW_FUNCTIONS empty.
