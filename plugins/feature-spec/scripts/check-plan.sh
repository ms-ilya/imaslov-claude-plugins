usage: check-plan.sh <plan-dir> --spec <path-to-spec.md> [options]

  <plan-dir>      the directory holding plan.md and tasks/

  --spec <path>   The spec every Covers tag and quoted done-condition must
                  resolve against. Required: a tag that cannot be resolved is
                  not a checked tag, and a check that examined nothing must not
                  report a pass — the same reason check-spec.sh demands --tree.

  --repo-root <d> Root for resolving Touches: and ## Seams paths. Default: the
                  nearest ancestor of <plan-dir> holding a .git, falling back to
                  the current directory. The hook cannot pass one — it knows only
                  the file that was written — and a path check resolved against
                  whatever the cwd happened to be would fail on every plan in a
                  repo Claude is not sitting at the root of.

  --closed-world  Check only what the plan ASSERTS, never what it OMITS.
                  A plan mid-write legitimately has three task files of six and
                  no graph table yet. Open-world checks fail on every honest
                  intermediate state, which teaches the writer to evade the
                  checker rather than satisfy it. A fabricated Covers tag is
                  wrong at task two of six exactly as it is wrong at the end.
                  Used by the PostToolUse hook. The full check runs at the gate.
