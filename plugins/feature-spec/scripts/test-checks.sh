Batch imports restart from zero after a crash.

## User stories

P1 · Resume an interrupted import

## Requirements

FR-001  The importer resumes from the last checkpoint on restart.
        ← Settled Q1
FR-002  The importer retries a failed row at most 5 times over 24 hours.
        ← Settled Q2
FR-003  Retry state is written to the existing checkpoint file.
        ← Grounding fact 1

## Success criteria

SC-001  An import interrupted at row 10000 resumes within 2 seconds.
        ← Strategy (chosen)
SC-002  A row that has failed 5 times appears in the reject file with its line number.
        ← ADR-0004

## Acceptance scenarios

FR-001  Given a checkpoint exists, when the importer starts, then it resumes from it.
FR-002  Given 5 attempts have been made, when a 6th is due, then the row is rejected.
FR-003  Given a retry is scheduled, when state is written, then it lands in the checkpoint file.

## Out of scope

- An external retry queue. ← Strategy (chosen)

## Open questions

- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Q12 — per-source overrides, low impact, deferred to post-launch]

# T02 — Resume from the checkpoint on start

Covers: FR-001, SC-001
Depends on: T01
Milestone: M1
Status: Planned
Touches: cmd/ingest/replay.go

## Goal

An interrupted import continues from the row the checkpoint names.

## Why now

Completes M1: with T01's state on disk, this is the behaviour a user sees.

## Action items

- [ ] Read the checkpoint on startup instead of starting at row 0
- [ ] Skip rows the checkpoint marks as ingested

## Done when

- FR-001  Given a checkpoint exists, when the importer starts, then it resumes from it.
- SC-001  An import interrupted at row 10000 resumes within 2 seconds.

# T03 — Enforce the attempt ceiling

Covers: FR-002
Depends on: T01

Touches: cmd/ingest/state.go

## Goal

A row stops being retried once it has been attempted 5 times.

## Why now

First task of M2, and the reject file in T04 has nothing to write without it.

## Action items

- [ ] Compare the attempt count against the ceiling before scheduling a retry

## Done when

- FR-002  Given 5 attempts have been made, when a 6th is due, then the row is rejected.

## Notes

## Execution summary

Touches: cmd/ingest/replay.go

## Goal

A row that exhausted its attempts appears in the reject file with its line number.

## Why now

Completes M2 — the operator-visible half of the ceiling.

## Action items

- [ ] Append the row and its line number to the reject file on exhaustion

## Done when

- SC-002  A row that has failed 5 times appears in the reject file with its line number.
